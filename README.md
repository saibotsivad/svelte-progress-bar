# svelte-progress-bar

The idea is a little Svelte component (check out [the demo](https://saibotsivad.github.io/svelte-progress-bar)) that shows a cool progress bar, like what's on YouTube, or [NProgress](https://ricostacruz.com/nprogress).

You can use it in your plain old web app, without bundling or anything, using the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/svelte-progress-bar/dist/ProgressBar.umd.js"></script>
<script>
	const progress = new ProgressBar({
		target: document.querySelector("body"),
	});
	// start it on a page load
	progress.start();
	// complete it at some point in the future
	setTimeout(() => {
		progress.complete();
	}, 1000);
</script>
```

Or to include it in your web app:

```js
import ProgressBar from "svelte-progress-bar";
// or
const ProgressBar = require("svelte-progress-bar");
// then
const progress = new ProgressBar({
	target: document.querySelector("body"),
});
```

Or if you are using the progress bar inside a Svelte template, you might use `bind:this` like this:

```html
<script>
	import ProgressBar from 'svelte-progress-bar'
	let progress
</script>
<ProgressBar bind:this={progress} />
<!-- then somewhere later -->
<button on:click={() => progress.setWidthRatio(0.4)}>
	Set to 40% Width
</button>
```

If you were using a web app with a router, or some sort of page change event emitter, it might look like:

```js
const router = // the page/state change event emitter
	router.on("stateChangeStart", () => {
		progress.start();
	});
router.on("stateChangeEnd", () => {
	progress.complete();
});
```

Or if you had some progress event emitter that actually told you the percent of progress, you might set the progress bar width manually with something like this:

```js
const dataLoad = // some sort of data load progress event emitter
	dataLoad.on("percentDone", (percent) => {
		progress.setWidthRatio(percent / 100); // must be a ratio
	});
dataLoad.on("end", () => {
	progress.complete();
});
```

## Svelte props

| Prop name | required? | default     | Description              |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| `color`   | Yes âœ…    | `undefined` | Set the bar's color.     |
| `zIndex`  | No        | `1`         | Set the bar's `z-index`. |

## Bar Color

The progress bar does **not** have a default color, so you will need to set one. You can either set the color as a data property or override the CSS.

JavaScript:

```js
const progress = new ProgressBar({
	target: document.querySelector("body"),
	props: { color: "#0366d6" },
});
```

Svelte component:

```html
<ProgressBar color="#0366d6" />
```

Or in your CSS:

```css
.svelte-progress-bar,
.svelte-progress-bar-leader {
	background-color: #0366d6;
}
.svelte-progress-bar-leader {
	color: #0366d6;
}
```

## z-index

If you are using some type of navbar at the top of the page, like Bootstrap's, it is likely that you will need to change the z-index to get the progress bar to appear over the navbar:

Svelte component:

```html
<ProgressBar zIndex="{200}" color="#000000" />
```

Plain CSS:

```css
.svelte-progress-bar {
	z-index: 100;
}
.svelte-progress-bar-leader {
	z-index: 101;
}
```

## Options

You shouldn't need to play with these, they've been selected based on UX design expertise, but they're available if you need them:

-   `minimum` _(number, range: 0-1, default: 0.08)_: The starting percent width use when the bar starts. Starting at `0` doesn't usually look very good.
-   `maximum` _(number, range: 0-1, default: 0.994)_: The maximum percent width value to use when the bar is at the end but not marked as complete. Letting the bar stay at 100% width for a while doesn't usually look very good either.
-   `intervalTime` _(number, default: 800)_: Milliseconds to wait between incrementing bar width when using the `start` (auto-increment) method.
-   `settleTime` _(number, default: 700)_: Milliseconds to wait after the `complete` method is called to hide the progress bar. Letting it sit at 100% width for a very short time makes it feel more fluid.

## Methods

These additional methods are available on an instantiated progress bar:

-   `start()`: Set the width to the minimum and increment until maximum width.
-   `complete()`: Set the width to `100%` and then hide after `settleTime`.
-   `reset()`: Set the width to minimum but do not start incrementing.
-   `animate()`: Start incrementing from whatever the current width is.
-   `stop()`: Stop incrementing and take no further action.
-   `setWidthRatio(ratio: number)`: Stop auto-incrementing and manually specify the width.
